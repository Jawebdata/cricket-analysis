End-to-end Cricket Data Analysis using Web Scraping, Python, Pandas, Power BI, and DAX — uncovering player insights, performance metrics, and match trends.
# 🏏 Cricket Analysis Project

## 🔍 Overview
This project is an **end-to-end Cricket Data Analysis** workflow.  
I collected cricket player and match data using **web scraping**, cleaned and analyzed it in **Python (Pandas)**, and finally built an **interactive Power BI dashboard** with insights using **DAX formulas**.

The main goal is to find trends in player performance, team results, and overall match analytics.
